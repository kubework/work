# Work Community

Welcome to the Work community!

Work is an open, community driven project to make it easy to use Kubernetes for getting useful work done.  This document describes the organizational structure of the Work Community including the roles, responsibilities and processes that govern Work projects and community.

Community meeting notes is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16aWGQ1Te5IRptFuAIFtg3rONRQqHC1Z3X9rdDHYhYfE/edit?usp=sharing).

The projects are:
